# TimeAndSales
Time and Sales Column for the Ninjtrader v8 SuperDOM
 
>Giving credit where credit is due. This custom time and sales column 
for the SuperDOM is built on the original code published by NinjaTrader_ZacharyG 
on the Ninjatrader Ecosystem.

  
**This version has been modified to include:**
- Regular and Filtered T&S panels
- Option to turn off Timestamp
- Display full or shortened price (ex. 89.40 instead of 4289.40)
- Detect potential ICE executions (that exceed bid/ask sizes)
- Trade aggregation
   - Accumulating trades till the price or trade type (at bid/at ask/above etc) changes.

This version also implements limiting T&S data held in memory during the session, to prevent memory problems.
 
Enjoy!
